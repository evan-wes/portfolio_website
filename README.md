# portfolio_Website
Flask based personal portfolio webpage

This is a personal portfolio webpage built in python using the `flask` framework with the `jinja` templating engine.

The website is deployed on heroku at [https://evanwesley.herokuapp.com/](https://evanwesley.herokuapp.com/) and also under the domain [http://www.evanwes.com/](http://www.evanwes.com/)

The webpage uses static HTML/CSS to present a background and portfolio of projects. The project details are contained in a PostgreSQL database managed by heroku which is queried to bring up each project's individual page.
