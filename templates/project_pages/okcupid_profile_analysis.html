<h1>OKCupid Profile Analysisn</h1>
<p>This project makes use of several supervised machine learning methods to analyse data contained in a sample of dating profiles from the website OKCupid. The goal of this project was to see if it is feasable to infer information about users when profiles are incomplete. Dating profiles contain all sorts of information about a user and the type of people they may be interested in. One type of information that OKCupid asks of users concerns their astrological sign. Users can select their sign, as well as <emph>how important</emph> their sign is to them and potential romantic interests. The purpose of obtaining this information is presumably to assist in finding possible matches with other users who answered similarly. However, if a user <emph>does not</emph> provide this information, it may be because they either did not completely fill out their profile, or mor interestingly that they purposely left this question blank because astrology is not a subject they hold in much esteem. This second reason could actually help match these users with like-minded people who also do not hold much weight to astrology, who also did not fill out any information about their sign. Given all this, it stands to reason that it may be possible to predict how important a users astrological sign is to them, if this information is left out of their profile.

Towards these ends, we use a handful of machine learning techniques to analyse the information contained on users dating profiles to try to predict 1) the astrological sign of the user and 2) how important one's sign is to themselves and possible romantic partners. Techniques used include linear regression, K-Nearest-Neighbors, and Decision Trees. Before getting to predictions, the data is first cleaned and exploratory data analysis is conducted. The data contains several categorical features that are transformed to numerical features using either one-hot encoding or a linear ranking. After this is done, models are trained and the name of the astrological sign, and level of importance are predicted. As guessed early in this project, the actual sign itself will be very poorly predicted, since it depends solely on date of birth. The level of importance, however, was predicted at levels around 50% accuracy. There is certainly room for improvement, such as better handling of the non-uniform distribution of users' astrological sign importance, with the large majority indicated their sign was 'fun to think about' or 'doesn't matter', compared with few selecting 'Matters a lot'. Another area to improve the results could be to use natural language processing techniques to extract features from the open-ended questions that contain the bulk of the information on users dating profiles. All in all, this was a fun project to practice the data analysis work flow, starting with unclean, raw data all the way to model predictions and evaluation.

This project was developed using Juptyer Notebooks. Please take a look at my <a href="https://github.com/evan-wes/OKCupid_Profile_Analysis">GitHub</a> page for the full source code.
