<h1>Naive Bayes Classification with sklearn</h1>
<p>This project highlights the use of the sklearn library for classification using the Naive-Bayes algorithm. We include a comprehensive mathematical background page for a refresher on the underpinnings of this simple, yet powerful classification technique. We then provide complete walkthroughs of classification with two datasets: the Iris dataset, comprised of numerical data on samples of the Iris flower, and the 20 Newsgroups dataset, which is composed of entirely textual samples taken from internet postings on twenty different categories.</p>
